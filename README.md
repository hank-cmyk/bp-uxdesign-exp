# bp-uxdesign-exp
bp Digital Design and UX Job Simulation program, taken through Forage
Completed modules in parts of the user-centered design process for an EV app, including user persona, low and high-fidelity wireframes, and a final interactive iOS prototype using Figma. 

Includes:
- Use of user-centered design process and thinking throughout entire experience
- bp User Persona: User persona for an EV app, including persona's core needs, frustrations/pain points, and a general biography and personality trait list
- bp low-fid wireframes: Hand-drawn low-fidelity wireframes for an EV app that addresses the user persona's core needs and pain points
- bp high-fid wireframes: High-fidelity wireframes made using Figma and the iOS App UI Wireframe Kit, improving upon iterations of the previous low-fidelity wireframes
